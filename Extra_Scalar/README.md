The constrains on the the mass of the standard model (SM) Higgs boson at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) experiments can also be applied to other extended scalars of the SM,
	where their coupling with Z boson and their decay branch ratio are very similar to the SM Higgs.

	However, in many other models with additional Higgs sectors, e.g. 2HDM, NMSSM, there exists a lighter scalar h, and
	the coupling of hZZ can be very small in some reasonable parameters spaces, as expected from the SM-likeness of the
	125-GeV higgs boson.

	Light Higgs bosons with suppressed couplings to the Z would in turn have escaped from the detection at LEP due to its limited luminosity.
	With a factor 1000 higher luminosity and polarized beams, the ILC is expected to have substancial discovery potential
	for such states.

	On the other hand, the additional scalar search at LEP and current LHC are usually dependent on the model details, such as their decay channels, so it is necessary to have a more general analysis with model-independent
	assumptions.

In this work, we perform a search of a light higgs boson produced in association with Z boson at the International Linear Collider (ILC)
	with a center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV, using the full Geant4-based simulation of the ILD detector concept.

	For a model-independent consideration, the analysis is performed using the recoil technique, in particular with the Z boson decaying into
	a pair of muons.

	As a preliminary result, the ILC's discovery and exclusion potential will be shown for different higgs masses between 10 and 115 GeV.
