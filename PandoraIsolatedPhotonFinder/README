Description:
  This processor takes an input collection of ReconstructedParticle.
  The input collection is split into two, a list of ISR photon and
  a list of everything else. The two separated lists are written as
  output collections.
  - OutputCollectionIsolatedPhotons
  - OutputCollectionWoIsolatedPhoton

  See the example directory for some steering example.
